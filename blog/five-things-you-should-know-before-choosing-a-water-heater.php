<p>Water heaters have become an essential investment, especially during the colder months. In a country like India, where temperatures vary significantly, the need for a reliable water heater depends on your region and lifestyle. Once considered a luxury, water heaters are now a necessity, saving time and effort in our fast-paced lives. Gone are the days of boiling water on the stove – a task that feels outdated when modern water heaters offer both convenience and efficiency. With advancements in technology, choosing the right water heater can enhance comfort for you and your family. Before making your purchase, it's important to consider these five key factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Nature of Usage:</b> The type of water heater needed for your home depends on its use. While people residing in low-temperature areas use hot water for a wide range of chores like washing utensils, clothes and more, those in warmer temperatures may use it for an occasional shower. Families of two can do with <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/electricals/heaters/category/instant-water-heaters/">instant water heaters</a> having a capacity of one litre, however, larger families might require a heater with a capacity of three litres or more, such as the IVAS Jetsy model.</li>
<li><b>Space for the installation:</b> Consider the location where you plan to install the water heater and assess the size of your available space. Ensure that the water heater fits comfortably in your home; compact instant models are ideal for smaller areas, while storage water heaters need more space. It's also important to estimate installation costs and check the warranty provided by the brand. Additionally, versatile options like the IVAS Thermosa, can be mounted on either the floor or wall to suit your space needs.</li>
<li><b>Energy efficiency:</b> Water heaters tend to use more electricity compared to other household appliances, so it’s wise to invest in a model with a five-star energy rating. Higher energy efficiency means less heat is lost over time, saving electricity in the long run. With global warming becoming an increasing concern, choosing energy-saving options is more important than ever. Additionally, you should ensure that the electrical supply in your home can support the water heater's capacity before making a purchase. All IVAS storage water heaters are five-star rated, ensuring top efficiency and performance.</li>
<li><b>Required Water Pressure:</b> Water heater pressure is measured in bars, commonly referred to as bar pressure. Most instant water heaters available offer a 6.5-bar pressure, ideal for not only independent homes but also high-rise buildings. However, in high-rise buildings, one can choose <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/electricals/heaters/category/storage-water-heaters/">storage water heaters</a> which come with an 8-bar pressure to handle the increased water supply demand effectively.</li>
<li><b>Décor Needs:</b> Geysers have always been an unattractive feature of a home due to their bulky structure and plain finish. Although it was not an issue in the past, the same design is no longer appealing as people have gotten more attentive towards décor. As a result, people with water heater at home now hide it with a curtain or build a cabinet around it. But recently, brands like IVAS have launched <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/electricals/heaters/">water heaters</a> designed to appeal to this segment of the market, who want their heaters to be aligned their décor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you're looking for a water heater for occasional hot showers or daily household use, these key considerations will guide you toward the right choice and ensure you make a well-informed, energy-efficient decision that meets your needs for years to come.</p>
