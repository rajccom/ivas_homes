<p>It’s summer and with temperatures soaring around 40 degrees, the beads of sweat trickling down your face make it difficult to focus on work. With the increase in average global temperatures due to global warming, dragging through summers has become tougher. You can no longer ignore the need to replace the old, squeaky ceiling fan in your living room. So, you decide to search for a new ceiling fan. You open the Internet, and now you are overwhelmed by choices. Do I need a smart ceiling fan, an under light one or a remote-controlled one? Or…just a basic fan to beat the heat? </p>

<p>Let us help you find the perfect summer companion by exploring these five features:</p>

<ul class="blog-point-list">
<li>
<b>Basic, Modern, or Luxurious:</b> First focus on what kind of fan you want.

Consider factors such as your lifestyle, room size, and aesthetic preferences to guide your decision. You can start by looking into different segments from the basic and functional to the modern and smart ceiling fans.</li>
<li>
<b>Performance:</b> Once you have determined the style and segment that aligns with your preferences, it's essential to know its performance. Consider factors such as airflow efficiency, noise levels, and energy consumption to ensure optimal functionality. Whether you prioritize powerful cooling or whisper-quiet operation, evaluating performance will help you find a <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/electricals/fans/">summer ceiling fan</a> that meets your needs. For e.g. The BLDC fan range from IVAS Electricals ensures a high-performance fan with a sweep size of 1200 mm.  
</li>
<li>
<b>BEE Star Rating:</b> BEE ratings (Bureau of Energy Efficiency Ratings) are a new feature as compared to the traditional fans of yesteryears, but they are crucial in today's environment. The higher the star rating, the greater the energy efficiency and utility savings. Tested in a lab accredited by NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories), a fan with a higher star rating can effectively cool your home without the guilt of excessive energy consumption.
</li>
<li>
<b>Innovation:</b> At a time when we are moving along with faster and more stressful lives, technologically advanced ceiling fans can offer a much-needed reprieve. Features such as remote control, and the latest Photon Orb Sieve (POS) Technology in India can significantly enhance the ambiance of your living room or bedroom. IVAS Electricals' Magnus ceiling fan, based on POS technology, stands out in terms of innovation in the premium segment, offering aesthetic colour options like Shimmer White and Cobalt Blue.
</li>
<li>
<b>Bi-Directional Rotation:</b> In hot summer months, a ceiling fans rotate anticlockwise, pushing cooler air downward and creating a wind chill effect. <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/electricals/fans/">Modern ceiling fans</a> equipped with bi-directional rotation make it possible to give cooler air during summer and warmer during winter thus, offering versatility and efficiency.
