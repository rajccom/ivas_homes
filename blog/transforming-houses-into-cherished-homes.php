In India, the joy of celebrations, special occasions, or moving into a new home often begins with a heartfelt makeover. Paint the walls, decorate it, or upgrade some of our appliances. It just makes that festive vibe even more exciting! No wonder, during Diwali, Christmas or even Eid, we have our homes decked up all set and ready for guests to arrive and enjoy some poignant moments with children, relatives, friends and neighbours. All in all, we humans are social beings, and we cherish these happy and amazing moments more than words can express.
</p>


<p>Embracing the philosophy of "Ghar Dhadakne Do," which transcends mere physical houses, we capture the emotional essence of a home. It invites us to view our homes as spaces that are alive and have a heart that beats. They are filled with love, laughter, and memories. From purchasing a house to experiencing life’s highs and lows, our homes gradually become treasures that hold our stories. The latest IVAS campaign beautifully conveys this idea, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty" target="_blank">Shilpa Shetty Kundra</a> states, “When you love your home, it loves you back.” This heartfelt message underscores the powerful bond we share with our homes, where every corner holds a memory and every wall tells our journey.</p>

<p>Empowering homeowners with Ghar Dhadakne Do: IVAS not only celebrates the emotional value of homes but also listens to its customers to ensure their unique needs are met. Guided by the philosophy of ‘Ghar Dhadakne Do’, we believe a home is alive and it is just like a family member. It is a safe space where memories are made, dreams are nurtured, and identities are celebrated. IVAS empowers homemakers with homes that are uniquely their own, much like the heartbeat of their lives. </p>
