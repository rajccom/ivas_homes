<p class="blog-sup-point"><strong>Types of Water Closets/Bidets </strong></p>


<div id="list-point" class="blog-con-section">

<ul class="blog-point-list">
<li>
  <b>Wall-Hung Closet:</b> A Wall-Hung Closet is suspended and fixed into a wall without a visible tank and pedestal, giving an illusion of more space. This kind of closet is mostly preferred by people who desire a minimalist but stylish design. Also, such closets are the perfect choice for small, compact places.
</li>
<li>
<b>One-Piece Water Closet:</b> When it comes to closets, one of the most common designs is the One-Piece Water Closet. As the bowl is 
directly connected to the tank, it becomes a seamless unit. While this closet saves a lot of space, it is also easy to clean and maintain, as one doesn’t have to struggle to reach the areas mostly inaccessible in other tanks.


</li>
<li>
<b>Floor Mounted Bidet:</b> Floor-mounted toilets offer a separate attachment for washing and cleaning. Most bidets of this kind come with a customizable spray setting allowing the users to adjust the water pressure. In addition to their easy installation, these can be utilized in bathrooms of all sizes.
</li>
<li>
<b>Electronic Flush Toilet:</b> <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/sanitaryware/products.php?type=Electro-flush-Closet">Electronic flush toilets</a> have a sensor-based flush system that can sense the presence of the user and flush automatically. It promotes hygiene by eliminating the need of touching the toilet handle. Many such bidets come with adjustable water temperature and pressure, as well as feminine and posterior wash systems.

</li>
<li>
<b>Smart Intelligent Toilet:</b> In addition to electronic flush toilet features, smart intelligent toilets offer heated seats to provide warmth during winter, and an air-drying system to gently dry the user after cleaning up. You will be surprised to know that some of these toilets come with self-cleaning features after using them, ensuring ultimate hygiene.

</ul>

<p class="blog-sup-point"><strong>Types of Wash Basins</strong></p>

<div id="list-point" class="blog-con-section">

<ul class="blog-point-list">
<li>
  <b>Wall Hung Basin:</b> Wall hung basins are mounted on the wall instead of being supported by a pedestal. Due to this reason, a lot of the floor space is freed up. Mounted at user-friendly heights and easier to clean, these provide a stylish and space-saving solution. They are great for small bathrooms because there's no need for counter space.

</li>
<li>
<b>Tabletop Wash Basin:</b> Also known as countertop basins, <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/sanitaryware/products.php?type=Table-Top-Basins">tabletop wash basins</a> are placed on top of a vanity cabinet, countertop, or table. This feature gives a cleaner look and adds class and style to your washroom. They also free up a lot of counter space as well, that can accommodate other toiletries.
</li>
<li>
<b>One Piece Wash Basin:</b> One piece wash basins are structured in such a way that the pedestal and the basin are unified into a single piece. The seamless integration of the basin and pedestal creates a harmonious and sleek, modern design, enhancing the overall aesthetics. Unlike other bath fittings accessories, these are easy to install, simple to clean, and available in various shapes and sizes.
</li>
<li>
<b>Wash Basin with Half Pedestal:</b> These kinds of basins are fixed on the wall and are supported by a half pedestal that extends to a certain extent. An undermount design, popularly chosen for smaller washrooms, hides the unpleasant sight of pipework. It can be installed at the perfect height for easy access and cleaning.

</li>
<li>
<b>Wash Basin with Full Pedestal:</b> These types of basins are a classic add-on to a washroom. They are versatile and can be installed in washrooms of all sizes, complementing various décor ideas and blending with other designs. Supported by the pedestal, they can be purchased separately or as a set that includes the pedestal and a detachable basin.
</li>
</ul>
