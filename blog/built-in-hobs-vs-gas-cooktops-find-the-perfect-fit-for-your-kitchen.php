Choosing the right kitchen appliance can significantly impact both the functionality and aesthetics of your culinary space. When it comes to smart kitchen upgrades, one should find the right balance between form and function. Whether your priority is traditional and classic gas cooktop with an open flame or an elegant built-in hob with modern energy efficiency, knowing the distinction between the two is crucial for setting up the kitchen which not only complements your own cooking preferences but also enhances the look and ambience of your space.
</p>

<p>Here's a guide to help you simplify the process to choose between the two for your pantry according to your preference:</p>

<p class="blog-sup-point"><strong>What Are Built-In Hobs and Gas Cooktops?</strong></p>
<p>Built-in hobs are integrated to the kitchen counter providing a compact and chic appearance, that come in different formations such as gas, electric or induction. These are specifically designed to fit multiple burners.</p>
<p>Whereas <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/appliances/kitchen/category/cooktop/" target="_blank">gas stoves/cooktops</a> are freestanding, placed on the counter, which generate heat from natural gas or LPG. Each burner has a control knob helping the user to adjust the gas flow.</p>

<p class="blog-sup-point"><strong>Difference Between Hobs and Gas Stoves/Cooktops</strong></p>
<div id="list-point" class="blog-con-section">

<ul class="blog-point-list">
<li>
<p class="blog-sup-point"><b>Elegant Design</b></p>
<p><b>Built-in hobs</b> are designed to enhance the aesthetics of your cooking space and blend in with the kitchen ambience seamlessly. To add a hint of luxury to your kitchen, you can opt for a gas hob with decorative gold finish aluminum trim design.</p>
<p><b>Gas stoves</b> can be a classic centerpiece in a large kitchen area. <a href="https://www.ivas.homes/appliances/kitchen/category/cooktop/" target="_blank">IVASâ€™ ultra slim compact design cooktops</a> along with stylish, sleek and durable knobs gives a smart look to your space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blog-sup-point"><b>Safety Features</b></p>
  <p><b>Built-In Hobs</b> come with safety features such as automatic shut off for enhanced protection. Many brands in the industry also offer flame failure devices (FFD) which automatically turns off the gas if the flame goes out accidentally, for advanced safety. There are also timers that can be used to prevent food from burning, increasing the efficiency of these hobs.</p>
  <p><b>Gas Stoves/Cooktops</b> use safety features that involve cooler surfaces protecting users from burns and other injuries. Many cooktops have anti-skid rubber legs that provide extra precaution and support for the appliance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p class="blog-sup-point"><b>Installation </b></p>
<p><b>Built-in hobs</b> need to be incorporated into the countertop, hence, require professional assistance for installation for ultimate functioning and safety.</p>
<p><b>Gas Stoves/Cooktop</b> can be installed easily without professional help. They are standalone and hence, can be kept on any surface and plugged into the gas supply.</p>

<li>
<p class="blog-sup-point"><b>Maintenance </b></p>
<p><b>Built-in hobs</b> are easier to clean, since they are attached to the countertop. Thus, any spills or drips can be wiped off efficiently. However, they are also quite delicate requiring more care than sturdy gas stoves.</p> 
<p><b>Gas Stoves</b> need precise cleaning since there may be grates and drip pans with spills and crumbs falling behind the cooktop which requires additional cleaning. One can also clean the burners and the rings separately, which makes cleaning gas stoves a lot more convenient.</p>
<li>
<p class="blog-sup-point"><b>Cost </b></p> 
<p><b>Built-in Hobs</b> are expensive considering their functionality, features, design and appearance.</p>
<p><b>Gas Stoves</b> are typically less in price because of their simplicity and ease of installation and use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
